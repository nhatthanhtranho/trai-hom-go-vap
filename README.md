# Sinh Ph√∫c Th·ªç Blog (Next.js Project)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
It is a **sub-product of [Sinh Ph√∫c Th·ªç](https://sinhphuctho.com)**, designed for creating and managing blog articles related to funeral services, cultural practices, and memorial content in Vietnam.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Project Structure

The project follows the **Next.js App Router** structure:

```
app/
  ‚îú‚îÄ cam-nang/         # Blog posts (each folder contains a post with page.tsx)
  ‚îú‚îÄ components/       # Reusable components (e.g., SimpleSlider, PostCard)
  ‚îú‚îÄ layout.tsx        # Root layout
  ‚îú‚îÄ page.tsx          # Homepage
  ‚îî‚îÄ globals.css       # Global Tailwind styles
```

* **Blog Posts**: Each post is a folder inside `app/cam-nang` with a `page.tsx`.
* **Components**: Includes sliders, cards, banners, and reusable UI elements.
* **Global Styles**: Tailwind CSS directives are in `globals.css`.

## Features

   ```
2. Add your content inside `page.tsx` using JSX, Tailwind classes, and any reusable components.
